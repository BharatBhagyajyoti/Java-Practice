Features of the Implementation
=================================s

Encapsulation:
----------------
The MobilePhone class encapsulates all attributes and behaviors related to the phone, making it easy to manage.

Polymorphism:
-------------
By using the SIMCardInterface, the MobilePhone can work with any SIM implementation (Airtel, Jio, BSNL), showcasing polymorphism.

Flexibility:
------------
Adding new SIM providers (e.g., Vodafone) is straightforwardâ€”just implement SIMCardInterface.

Flexibility and Loosely Coupled Design:
---------------------------------------
The use of interfaces is a good design choice, as it ensures that the MobilePhone class is not tightly coupled to
specific SIM implementations. This promotes scalability and flexibility.
