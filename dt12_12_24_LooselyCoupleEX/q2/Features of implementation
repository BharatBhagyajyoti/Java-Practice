Features of the Implementation
=================================

Loosely Coupled Architecture:
-----------------------------
The Customer class interacts with banks through the Bank interface, making it independent of specific bank implementations.
Adding new banks requires minimal changes.

Encapsulation:
--------------
Each bank class encapsulates its accountBalance and transaction logic.
Polymorphism:

The Customer interacts with different banks using the same interface methods (deposit, withdraw, checkBalance).

Demonstration:
---------------
The TestBankingSystem class demonstrates how the customer can interact with multiple banks seamlessly.
